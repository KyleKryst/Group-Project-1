# Screen-Scoop
## Group Project #1
Screen Scoop is a website for users to check movie reviews and find theatres close by. The user can search for any movie by its title.
When the user searches for a particular movie they can view a summary of each movie, including its rating, release date, a brief plot summary, and can read reviews of the movie.
